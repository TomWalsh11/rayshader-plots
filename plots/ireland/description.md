# **Population Density of Ireland – Kontur Population Dataset 2022**

This plot visualises the population density of Ireland using the **Kontur Population Dataset 2022**. The dataset has been processed to represent population density through **400-meter hexagons**, providing a detailed and easily interpretable view of how population is distributed across the country.

### **Key Highlights:**
- **Hexagonal grid**: The 400-meter hexagons offer a balanced representation, reducing distortion often seen with square grids.
- **Population density**: The plot visually communicates how densely populated different areas of Ireland are, using color gradients to depict variations in population density.

This visualisation is designed to give insights into Ireland’s demographic structure, highlighting both urban and rural population clusters.
